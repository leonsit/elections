Good Afternoon Leon,

 

Thank you for your inquiry. I have attached here a precinct-level breakdown of results numbers for the 2020 Presidential contest. Our office is currently working to scan all the archived results tapes so that there may be copies of the primary documents that accompany this data. This full package should be available upon request by the end of next week.

For now, I have attached just the spreadsheet here. At this time, the summary spreadsheet only has the numbers for the presidential contest. We do not have full precinct breakdowns aggregated for the down-ballot races.

 

Left side is what was reported to the state. Right side is what was actually printed onto the results tapes. There is a color key at the end of the spreadsheet to help you identify the discrepancies as well. Errors are in red. Yellow helps highlight that the discrepancies tended towards (but weren’t always related to) precincts with a split. For 2020 election, the tapes were not programmed to delineate which part of the split a vote had come from, instead just lumping it all into one number. This why there are empty rows on that side of the spreadsheet and presumably also partly why there reporting errors to begin with.

 

Additionally, to explain why the Cap numbers are so large, in 2020 CAP was not required to further report by individual voters’ home precincts, so instead lumps together all Early and Mail ballots cast for the entire county. Considering that 2020 was also the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, those absentee numbers even larger as people exercised alternate voting methods to preserve social distancing mandates.

 

I hope this is easy enough to follow. If you have any further questions about how to interpret the spreadsheet, or develop additional follow-up questions, please give me a call.
